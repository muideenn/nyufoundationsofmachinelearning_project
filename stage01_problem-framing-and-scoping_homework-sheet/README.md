# Project Title  
**Cross-Asset Correlation Analysis**  
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)  

## Problem Statement  
Financial markets are highly interconnected, and the correlation between different asset classes (such as equities, bonds, and commodities) shifts under varying economic and market conditions. Understanding these correlations is critical for risk management, asset allocation, and portfolio diversification. The problem is that investors and fund managers often rely on static or outdated assumptions about correlations, which may not reflect current market realities.  

This project aims to analyze cross-asset correlations dynamically, identifying how relationships between asset classes change over time and under stress conditions (e.g., recessions, inflationary periods, monetary policy shifts). The findings will help stakeholders make better-informed decisions about hedging, diversification, and capital allocation.  

## Stakeholder & User  
- **Primary Stakeholder:** Portfolio managers and risk managers at hedge funds, trading firms, and asset management companies.  
- **End Users:** Quantitative analysts and traders who implement strategies and monitor portfolio risk.  
- **Context:** Stakeholders need real-time and historical insights into cross-asset relationships to guide decisions about portfolio rebalancing, hedging strategies, and stress testing.  

## Useful Answer & Decision  
- **Type of Answer:** Descriptive & Predictive.  
- **Outputs:**  
  - Correlation matrices and heatmaps across equities, bonds, and commodities.  
  - Time-varying correlation analysis (e.g., rolling-window, DCC-GARCH).  
  - Stress-period analysis showing shifts in correlations during crises.  
- **Decision Impact:**  
  - Adjusting asset allocation for diversification.  
  - Anticipating breakdowns in hedging effectiveness.  
  - Informing strategy development for trading and risk management.  

## Assumptions & Constraints  
- Historical data for equities, bonds, and commodities is available and reliable.  
- Correlation patterns are informative for future diversification strategies.  
- Analysis will be limited to major indices (e.g., S&P 500, U.S. Treasuries, Gold/Oil).  
- Computational capacity is sufficient for rolling-window and advanced econometric models.  

## Known Unknowns / Risks  
- Correlations are not stable and may shift unpredictably during market crises.  
- Limited availability of clean, high-frequency data across all asset classes.  
- Risk of overfitting models if using too many variables or complex econometric techniques.  
- Macro shocks (e.g., policy changes, geopolitical events) may distort correlation patterns.  

## Lifecycle Mapping  
Goal → Stage → Deliverable  
- Define the real-world problem → Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01) → Scoping paragraph in README.md  
- Identify stakeholders → Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01) → Stakeholder memo / persona  
- Establish assumptions, risks, and constraints → Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01) → Section in README.md  
- Initialize repo → Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01) → GitHub repo with folder tree  

## Repo Plan  
- Folder structure: `/data/`, `/src/`, `/notebooks/`, `/docs/`  
- README.md with scoping text, stakeholder goals, and lifecycle mapping.  
- Cadence: Update repo weekly with data, models, and results.

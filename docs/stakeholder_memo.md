# Stakeholder Memo  

**To:** Portfolio Managers & Risk Managers  
**From:** Quant Research Team  
**Subject:** Cross-Asset Correlation Analysis  

## Context  
Portfolio managers rely on correlations between equities, bonds, and commodities to diversify risk. However, correlations change dynamically, especially during crises, reducing the effectiveness of traditional hedges.  

## Objective  
This project will analyze how correlations shift across asset classes under different market regimes (growth, inflation, recession, crises). The goal is to provide decision-ready metrics for adjusting hedging strategies and improving diversification.  

## Deliverables  
- Correlation matrices (static and time-varying).  
- Stress-period analysis of asset co-movements.  
- Visualizations (heatmaps, rolling correlations).  

## Impact  
- Better allocation decisions.  
- Early warning signals for correlation breakdowns.  
- Stronger quantitative foundation for portfolio hedging strategies.
